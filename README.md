This webpage is meant for people to create and share any kind of stories in video game format. You can have multiple choices within the story that will lead to limitless endings. 
This is meant to engage the reader and make them a part of decision making within the story.
This mechanic was inspired by RPG games like Fallout. If you're not able to understand how to use it properly, you can message me on Github at github.com/CyberGeek121.
